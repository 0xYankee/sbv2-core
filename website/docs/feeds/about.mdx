An aggregator or data feed is what on-chain developers use when building smart
contracts. A data feed is a collection of jobs that get aggregated to produce a
single, deterministic result. Typically the first task in a job will fetch
external data with subsequent tasks responsible for parsing the response and
transforming the value into a single data type, like an integer or decimal.

When an oracle is assigned to process a data feed update, the oracle executes
the defined jobs, computes the weighted median of the job responses, and
publishes the result on-chain. If sufficient oracles respond, the on-chain
program computes the final result as the median of the assigned oracle
responses.

## Configuration

<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid item md={4} sm={12} order={{ xs: 2, sm: 1 }}>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Aggregator: </b>Contains the data feed configuration, dictating how
        data feed updates get requested, updated, and resolved on-chain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Job Account: </b>Stores the blueprints for how data is fetched
        off-chain for a particular data source.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Permission Account: </b>Permits a data feed to join an oracle queue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lease Contract: </b>Pre-funded escrow contract to reward oracles for
        their work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Crank: </b>Optional, owned by the queue and allows a data feed to be
        updated at a regular interval.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>History Buffer: </b>Optional, allows a feed to store the last N
        values.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Grid>

## Job Definitions

An Aggregator Account stores a collection of Job Account public keys along with
the hashes of the job definitions. This is to prevent malicious RPC nodes from
providing incorrect task definitions to oracles before fulfillment.

A Job Account is a collection of [Switchboard Tasks](/feeds/tasks) that get
executed by an oracle sequentially. Each Job Account typically corresponds to a
single data source. A data feed requires at least one job account and at most 16
job accounts. Switchboard Job Accounts can be used to source data from:

- HTTP endpoints, public or private$^{[1]}$
- Websockets
- On-Chain data from Solana, Ethereum, etc
  - Anchor programs
  - JupiterSwap
  - Uniswap
  - SushiSwap
  - Saber
  - ... and more

$^{[1]}$ Endpoints requiring an API key require a
[Private APIs](/feeds/private-apis) to prevent leaking the API key on-chain

### Job Weights

A data feed can assign job weights to a job account which will be used when the
oracle calculates the median across the job responses. This is useful to weight
data sources by some metric such as liquidity or a reliability score.

It is **strongly** recommended to utilize job weights as _not all data sources
are created equally_.

Currently the only way to set a job weight is to remove and re-add the job
account to a feed.

## Data Feed Composability

Data feeds may reference other data feeds and build upon each other. It is
**_strongly_** recommended that you own any feed that you reference in case of
downstream impacts out of your control. While anyone can extend another feeds
lease, a lease owner can always withdraw any lease funds and prevent future
updates.

As an example, you could construct the following feed definition:

- Create a Switchboard feed that sources SOL/USD prices from a variety of
  exchanges, each weighted by their 7d volume, along with a history buffer
- Create a Switchboard feed that uses an OracleTask to fetch the Pyth SOL/USD
  price every 10 seconds, along with a history buffer
- Create a Switchboard feed that uses an OracleTask to fetch the Chainlink
  SOL/USD price every 10 seconds, along with a history buffer
- Finally, create a Switchboard feed that calculates the 1min TWAP of each
  source above and returns the median of the results

This is just a small window into how Switchboard feeds can build on each other
and let the downstream consumer configure their feeds to meet their own use
cases.
