Switchboard tasks are executed sequentially with the output of the previous task
provided as the input to the next task in a chain. After the final task, the
TaskRunner will attempt to convert the running result to a numeric value.

**_NOTE_**: Some task do not consume the running input such as HttpTask,
WebsocketTask, and most of the fetch tasks. If the TaskRunner sees one of these
task types in the middle of a job definition, it will effectively reset the
running result.
