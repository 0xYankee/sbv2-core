<CrankOverview />

The maximum update interval for a feed on a crank is based on its
`aggregator.minUpdateDelaySeconds` and can be calculated by:

$I_{Max} (seconds) = I_{minUpdateDelaySeconds}  + [5\quad\% \quad I_{minUpdateDelaySeconds}]$

An aggregator pushed onto a crank will have a maximum jitter of 5 seconds.
