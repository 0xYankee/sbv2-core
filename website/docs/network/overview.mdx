## Program State

<Grid container spacing={3} justifyContent="center" alignItems="center">
  <Grid item md={4} sm={12} order={{ xs: 2, sm: 1 }}>

Switchboard is a multi-chain oracle, currently deployed on Aptos, NEAR, and
Solana. Each is a native implementation with subtle differences but the overall
architecture remains the same. The top-level program state account controls the
token mint used for oracle rewards and data feed update costs for each queue.

Switchboard was architected to be permissionless and allow users to create and
manage their own Switchboard network. Each chain can support many oracle queues,
which can have varrying levels of security and trust assumptions.

## Oracle Queues

An oracle queue is an independent realm of oracles, responsible for allocating
oracle resources for update requests from data feeds, randomness, or buffer
relayers. Oracle queue's act as an aggregator for on-chain consumers looking to
publish data on-chain by specifying an upfront reward a requester is required to
pay when a new update is requested by an oracle. Oracles act as an off-chain
compute resource that can be utilized by on-chain programs needing a
decentralized way to source data.
