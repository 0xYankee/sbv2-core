## Overview

Switchboard Services is a serverless compute platform that enables developers to
write and deploy functions designed to perform specific tasks. Switchboard
handles the heavy lifting by matching developers' requests with oracles,
allowing them to focus on writing essential code without worrying about managing
servers, scaling, and availability.

## Use Cases

With Switchboard V3, developers can access powerful, customizable, and scalable
solutions to build and deploy serverless applications, such as:

- **Complex Risk Engines**: Create risk engines that perform calculations based
  on private market data, feeding directly into DeFi protocols.
- **Automated Trading Bots**: Develop and sell access to automated trading bots,
  guaranteeing privacy for users' wallet keys.
- **Complex Automation Flows**: Create intricate automation flows for
  applications that include processing data, sending notifications, and updating
  databases.

## Design

Switchboard V3 is a significant update to the Switchboard oracle ecosystem,
enhancing security, trust, and decentralization by leveraging Intel SGX
attestation. Switchboard V3 uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to create
a secure, verifiable, and trustless environment for oracles to operate,
addressing limitations of previous economic incentive-based security models.

In this new version, Switchboard oracles are encapsulated within TEEs,
generating unique digital signatures for the software running inside them and
the data produced. These signatures are posted on-chain for public verification,
ensuring a decentralized and verifiable system.

- Trusted enclaves are a specialized hardware that have the ability to create a
  signature of any program loaded into them, as well as confidentially encrypt
  them without any sensitive data ever leaving the chip.
- This means that you can load any program you wish into this environment,
  create an ed25519 keypair for your program to use, and create flows of
  transactions represented by your programs identity.
- The technology behind trusted enclaves ensures that this generated keypair can
  only ever be managed by the program the was originally signed off to run in
  the environment.
- Even adversaries with physical access to these machines will be unable to
  expose or use these keypairs

## FAQs

### What role does Switchboard play here?

- Switchboard provides the mechanism for which all machines using TEEs can
  easily verify themselves on chain, we abstract away the hard parts!

### How is this associated with Switchboard v3

- All Switchboard v3 oracles use this attestation to create secure proxies to
  the internet. If you request a page from binance.com on chain, we can
  guarantee the integrity of the information and report it on chain.

### How can I build my own service?

- We've exposed all the working pieces to our attestation service so anyone can
  easily onboard their own functions!
