Switchboard V3 uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel SGX to
verify the integrity of the code running within an enclave to prove it has not
been tampered with, reducing the degree of trust needed in decentralized
systems.

## Products

Trusted execution environments now power the following Switchboard products:

- **Switchboard Services:** enables developers to write and deploy code that
  will be run in a trusted execution environment. Fully customizable logic
  without sacrificing security.
- **Switchboard Streams:** technically data feeds, designed specifically to
  fetch data from on/off-chain data sources. The Switchboard Streams Builder
  enables developers to create data feeds seamlessly and with full
  customizability.
- **Switchboard Secrets:** provides developers a secure and confidential way to
  access private/gated APIs and data from off-chain sources. With v3, sensitive
  information can be processed and updated securely.
- **Switchboard pSeudorandomness:** a service for generating secure and
  verifiable on-chain randomness using the TEE oracles.
