title: TEE Overview
---

The following is a high level overview of TEEs and Intel Software Guard
Extensions (SGX). Refer to Intel's official documentation for more info.

## What are Trusted Execution Environments and SGX?

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure area within a device's
hardware or software that isolates sensitive data and code from the rest of the
system. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a hardware-based technology
that provides TEE capabilities. It allows developers to create secure enclaves
within the processor where sensitive information can be processed without the
risk of being accessed or modified by unauthorized parties. TEEs and Intel SGX
play a crucial role in securing sensitive data and code, ensuring privacy and
integrity in various applications.

## What problem does SGX solve?

In today's interconnected world, ensuring the security, privacy, and
verifiability of data and code has become increasingly important. However,
traditional security methods have struggled to keep up with the evolving threat
landscape. SGX addresses these challenges by providing a hardware-based solution
that protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and tampering, even
in the presence of a compromised operating system or other privileged software.
By offering a secure and isolated environment for running applications, SGX
enables developers to build trust in their systems and ensure the integrity of
their data and code.

## SGX Overview

Intel SGX is a set of hardware-based security features that are built into Intel
processors. It allows developers to create secure enclaves within the processor,
which are isolated from the rest of the system. These enclaves provide a secure
environment where sensitive data and code can be processed without the risk of
being accessed or modified by unauthorized parties. The key components of SGX
include:

- **Processor support**: Intel processors with SGX capabilities have specific
  hardware features that enable the creation and management of secure enclaves.
- **Enclave Page Cache (EPC)**: A protected memory area within the processor
  that stores the data and code associated with secure enclaves.
- **Memory Encryption Engine (MEE)**: A hardware component that encrypts and
  decrypts data as it is read from or written to the EPC.
- **Attestation**: A process that allows a remote party to verify the
  authenticity and integrity of an enclave and its contents.

## Enclaves

Enclaves are the central concept in Intel SGX technology. They are secure,
isolated execution environments within the processor that protect sensitive data
and code from unauthorized access and modification. Enclaves are created and
managed by the processor, ensuring that even privileged software, such as the
operating system or hypervisor, cannot access or tamper with the data and code
within the enclave.

An enclave can only be accessed via specific entry points, and all data entering
or leaving the enclave is encrypted and decrypted by the Memory Encryption
Engine (MEE). This ensures that the contents of the enclave remain confidential
and protected, even if the rest of the system is compromised.

## Attestation

Attestation is a critical process in Intel SGX technology that allows a remote
party to verify the authenticity and integrity of a secure enclave and its
contents. The attestation process involves the following steps:

- The enclave generates a report that contains a measurement of the enclave's
  contents (code and data) and a unique identifier.
- The report is signed by the enclave's private key, which is only accessible
  within the enclave itself.
- The signed report is sent to a remote party, who then verifies the signature
  using the enclave's public key

## Quote Verification

Quote verification is an essential step in the remote attestation process to
ensure that the code running within the enclave is genuine and untampered. The
enclave provides several components as part of the measurement that forms the
basis for the quote.

1. **Measurement**: The enclave produces a measurement of its code and data,
   which is a cryptographic hash (usually SHA-256) that represents the enclave's
   initial state. This measurement includes the enclave's identity, version, and
   any additional metadata required for attestation.
2. **Report**: The enclave generates a report containing the measurement, its
   state, and platform information. This report is specific to the local
   platform and cannot be used for remote attestation directly.
3. **Target Info**: The target info is provided by the quoting enclave, which is
   another secure enclave responsible for generating quotes. This information
   helps the enclave creating the report to target a specific quoting enclave
   for the attestation process.
4. **Report Data**: The report data is an optional field that can be used to
   include additional information or a custom payload, such as a public key or a
   nonce, which can be used during the quote verification process.

The quote generated by the quoting enclave primarily verifies the integrity and
authenticity of the enclave's measurement, ensuring that the code running within
the enclave has not been tampered with or altered. The quote also verifies the
identity and version of the enclave, providing the verifier with the necessary
information to establish trust in the remote enclave.

## Lifecycle

The following steps outline the remote attestation sequence:

- **Enclave creation**: The application creates an enclave using the SGX SDK,
  allocating memory and loading the code to be executed within the enclave.
- **Enclave initialization**: The enclave is initialized, and its secure memory
  regions are prepared for use.
- **Remote attestation process initiation**: The application requests a
  challenge from the remote party, which will be used during the attestation
  process.
- **Report generation**: The enclave generates a report containing its state,
  the code being executed, and the platform information.
- **Quote generation**: The report is converted into a quote by the quoting
  enclave, which includes the report's cryptographic signature.
- **Quote verification**: The remote party verifies the quote, either
  independently or using a trusted attestation service like Intel Attestation
  Service.
- **Secure communication**: If the quote is verified successfully, a secure
  communication channel is established between the remote party and the enclave.

## Conclusion

Intel SGX and other trusted execution environments significantly enhance the
security of computing systems by providing isolated environments for executing
sensitive code and protecting data. Through the use of attestation and quote
verification, these technologies enable external parties to establish trust in
the integrity and authenticity of the enclave, paving the way for secure
communication and computation even in potentially hostile environments. By
leveraging hardware-based isolation and cryptographic techniques, SGX and TEEs
can play a critical role in safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring the
privacy and security of modern computing systems.
