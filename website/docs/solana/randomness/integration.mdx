Switchboard's VRF implementation allows the creator to specify a program
callback that will be called each time a new proof is verified on-chain.

### Callback

When creating a VRF Account, the VRF `vrf.authority` _should_ specify a
`vrf.callback` function that will be called by the oracle when a new randomness
value is produced.

<CallbackZC />

## Pseudorandom Result

The VRF function produces a **_u8[32]_** buffer, `vrf.result`, that can be
transmuted to most data types using the
[bytemuck crate](https://crates.io/crates/bytemuck).

```rust
let result_buffer: [u8; 32];
// get result buffer from parsed VRF Account
msg!("Result buffer is {:?}", result_buffer);
let value: &[u128] = bytemuck::cast_slice(&result_buffer[..]);
msg!("u128 buffer {:?}", value);
let result = value[0] % max_result as u128;
msg!("Current VRF Value [0 - {}) = {}!", max_result, result);
```

## Update Cost

A VRF Account is required to have `0.002 wrapped SOL` in their `vrf.escrow`
before requesting randomness. If the `vrf.escrow` has insufficient funds, the
difference will be deducted from the requesters token wallet. The oracle
fulfilling the crank will receive `0.002 / 277 wrapped SOL` upon submitting the
proof, with the remaining amount being dispersed to the account who turned the
VRF crank, which is typically the oracle.

## Update Lifecycle

### Update Request

- The `vrf.authority` calls
  [vrfRequestRandomness](/solana/idl/instructions/vrfRequestRandomness)
- sbv2 program checks if the request is valid by:
  - The previous `vrf.status` is equal to **_StatusNone_**,
    **_StatusCallbackSuccess_**, or **_StatusVerifyFailure_**
  - The previous `vrf.status` is equal to **_StatusRequesting_**,
    **_StatusVerifying_**, or **_StatusVerified_** and one minute has elapsed
    since the previous VRF request
- sbv2 program sets the current `vrf.status` to **_StatusRequesting_**
- sbv2 program checks the requester provided the required oracle reward and
  transfers it to `vrf.escrow`
- sbv2 program increments `vrf.counter`
- sbv2 program emits
  [VrfRequestRandomnessEvent](/solana/idl/events/VrfRequestRandomnessEvent)

## Oracle Execution

- Oracle watches the chain for a
  [VrfRequestRandomnessEvent](/solana/idl/events/VrfRequestRandomnessEvent) with
  the oracle's public key assigned to the update request
- Oracle calculates the VRF proof and submits a
  [vrfProveAndVerify](/solana/idl/instructions/vrfProveAndVerify) instruction
  on-chain
  - Oracle receives 1 / 277 of the reward
- sbv2 program sets the current `vrf.status` to **_StatusVerifying_**
- Oracle submits 276 Ã—
  [vrfProveAndVerify](/solana/idl/instructions/vrfProveAndVerify) instructions
  on-chain
  - Invoker receives 1 / 277 of the reward per each successful instruction
- If proof verification fails,
  - sbv2 program sets `vrf.status` to **_StatusVerifyFailure_**
- If proof verification succeeds,
  - sbv2 program sets `vrf.status` to **_StatusVerified_**
  - Oracle invokes `vrf.callback`
  - If `vrf.callback` is successfully invoked,
    - sbv2 program sets `vrf.status` to **_StatusCallbackSuccess_**
