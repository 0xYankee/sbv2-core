:::caution

While Switchboard V2's oracle network is fully audited, the VRF implementation
is currently unaudited software. Please use at your own risk.

:::

Switchboard's VRF implementation uses the oracle authority secret key to publish
the VRF proof on-chain. The on-chain proof verification is very computationally
expensive and requires 276 instructions on-chain to fully verify. Once the proof
is submitted on-chain anyone can turn the VRF crank to produce the pseduorandom
result, although for simplicity and speed the Switchboard oracle that submitted
the proof also submits the verification instructions.

The final proof verification instruction invokes the VRF Account's specified
callback, which allows developers to integrate pseduorandomness into their
applications and be confident they are consuming the latest pseduorandom result.
