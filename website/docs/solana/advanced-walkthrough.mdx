This guide will walk you through building a ticket raffle on Solana, utilizing
Switchboard oracles and VRF for provable fairness.

## The Raffle Program

We'll be building a basic ticket raffle that lets a user deposit 1 USDC worth of
their favorite SPL Token and in return receive a raffle ticket. We'll utilize
Switchboard oracles in order to determine the amount of SPL Tokens to deposit so
the user is always exchanging 1 USDC worth. After some pre-determined amount of
time, the raffle will close and the program will request randomness from
Switchboard. Once the randomness is fulfilled, the Switchboard oracle will make
a cross-program invocation into our program and select the winner. This is web3
so we'll make it so any user can create their own lottery and invite users to
participate.

### Accounts

Our program will need the following accounts:

| Account      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ProgramState | Top level program PDA that will enforce all lotteries can only be created for a given Switchboard OracleQueue. <br /><br />This ensures a lottery authority cant create their own queue and oracles and cheat the users.                                                                              |
| Lottery      | Contains the:<br /><ul><li><b>LotteryConfig:</b> the duration, closing timestamp, and number of participants</li><li><b>TokenConfig:</b> the token mint, escrow, and the Switchboard Aggregator to use for pricing data</li><li><b>VrfConfig:</b> the Switchboard VRF to settle the results</li></ul> |
| Ticket       | Stores the user's raffle ticket and reward addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Instructions

Our program will need the following instructions:

| Instruction      | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `program_init`   | Initialize the ProgramState account and set the Switchboard OracleQueue.                                                                                        |
| `lottery_init`   | Initialize a lottery with a set of parameters.                                                                                                                  |
| `ticket_init`    | Transfer 1 USDC worth of a user's tokens to the lottery controlled escrow address and initialize a ticket for the user.                                         |
| `lottery_draw`   | Request randomness from the Switchboard OracleQueue.                                                                                                            |
| `lottery_settle` | This will be invoked by the Switchboard oracle and handle any logic for determining the winner. <br /><br /><b>NOTE:</b> This will be our callback instruction. |
| `lottery_close`  | After the lottery has been settled, allow a lottery authority to close a lottery and recoup any rent exemption.                                                 |
| `ticket_close`   | After the lottery has been settled, allow a user to close their ticket account and recoup any rent exemption.                                                   |

### Constraints

Let's quickly sketch out some edge cases we may encounter.

**No Users Enter the Lottery**

- We should enforce some minimum number of participants for our lottery. We dont
  want to request randomness if no one will win.

**User Buys a Ticket After the Lottery Ends**

- We should enforce an ending timestamp on the lottery so a user cannot purchase
  a ticket after a certain timestamp.

**Lottery Oracle Stale**

- We should define an oracles config so it is updating at a regular cadence.
- If the oracle is more than 5 minutes stale, we should prevent users from
  purchasing any tickets.
- If the oracle's confidence interval (standard deviation) exceeds some
  threshold, we should prevent the user from purchasing any tickets.
- **TWAP**: For more advanced cases we can utilize a Twap oracle so individual
  price samples are averaged out.

**VRF Request Failed**

- We should have some logic to re-request randomness if a previous request has
  failed.
- We should prevent multiple concurrent requests by enforcing some minimum time
  between requests.
- We should have some maximum number of retries that closes the lottery and
  let's users recoup their entrance fee.

## Buidl

Let's setup our anchor project and add some dependencies.

```bash
anchor init vrf-raffle
cd vrf-raffle
# javascript dependencies
yarn remove @project-serum/anchor
yarn add @coral-xyz/anchor \
  @solana/web3.js \
  @solana/spl-token \
  @switchboard-xyz/solana.js \
  @switchboard-xyz/common
# rust dependencies
cargo add switchboard-v2
cargo add bytemuck
cargo add solana-program
cargo add anchor-spl
```

Create your program deploy keypair, then update `Anchor.toml` and
`programs/vrf-raffle/src/lib.rs` with your unique program ID and build the
program.

```bash
# create
solana-keygen new -s --no-bip39-passphrase --outfile target/deploy/vrf_raffle-keypair.json
export VRF_RAFFLE_PROGRAM_ID=$(solana-keygen pubkey target/deploy/vrf_raffle-keypair.json)
sed -i '' 's/Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS/'"$VRF_RAFFLE_PROGRAM_ID"'/' Anchor.toml
sed -i '' 's/Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS/'"$VRF_RAFFLE_PROGRAM_ID"'/' programs/vrf-raffle/src/lib.rs
anchor build
```

Commit your changes

```bash
git add --all && git commit -m "init"
```

### `program_init`

First, let's remove the generated initialize instruction and replace it with the
boilerplate code for our `program_init` instruction. Then we'll add the
ProgramState account layout. We'll be storing the Switchboard programState bump
on our account so we dont need to provide it everytime we request randomness.

```rust title="programs/vrf-raffle/src/program_init.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct ProgramInit {}

#[derive(Clone, AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
pub struct ProgramInitParams {}

impl ProgramInit {
    pub fn validate(
        &self,
        ctx: &Context<Self>,
        params: &ProgramInitParams,
    ) -> anchor_lang::Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn actuate(ctx: &Context<Self>, params: &ProgramInitParams) -> anchor_lang::Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

```

```diff title="programs/vrf-raffle/src/lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

+ pub mod program_init;
+ pub use program_init::*;

declare_id!("4frepJahiLDWX4apn4XErpXcHUWSJEsjDVmrmrhAGBQn");

#[program]
pub mod vrf_raffle {
    use super::*;

-     pub fn program_init(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
-         Ok(())
-     }
+     #[access_control(ctx.accounts.validate(&ctx, &params))]
+     pub fn program_init(
+         ctx: Context<ProgramInit>,
+         params: ProgramInitParams,
+     ) -> anchor_lang::Result<()> {
+         ProgramInit::actuate(&ctx, &params)
+     }
}

- #[derive(Accounts)]
- pub struct Initialize {}

+ #[account(zero_copy)]
+ #[derive(AnchorSerialize)]
+ pub struct ProgramState {
+     pub bump: u8,
+     pub switchboard_state_bump: u8,
+     pub switchboard_queue: Pubkey,
+     // Buffer for future use
+     pub _ebuf: [u8; 1024],
+ }
```

:::tip

Add explanation for zero_copy and why its needed

:::

Great, we created the empty `program_init` instruction. We'll be following this
pattern for all of our instructions where each gets its own module which then
gets mapped in lib.rs with an access control to validate the parameters.

Now let's add some functionality to our `program_init` instruction. We will need
to:

- Allocate on-chain space for our ProgramState account
- Deserialize the Switchboard ProgramStateAccount and store the bump on our
  account
- Deserialize a provided Switchboard OracleQueueAccountData and ensure it has
  unpermissionedVrf set to true

```rust title="programs/vrf-raffle/src/program_init.rs"

```
