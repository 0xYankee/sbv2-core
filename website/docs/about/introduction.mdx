# Introduction

> Switchboard is a multi-chain oracle network that allows anyone to publish
> general purpose data feeds on-chain

Switchboard gets its name from the early days of phone networks, where operators
would shuffle telephone lines around a switchboard to complete a circuit and
forward a dialerâ€™s call to the next hop in the circuit. Similarly, Switchboard
is responsible for how external data gets updated and routed through a
blockchain until it reaches its appropriate destination.

At a high level, Switchboard is a proxy between the internet and a blockchain
allowing data feeds to be matched with off-chain compute resources, thus
allowing the feeds to periodically request updates and reward oracles for
answering honestly.

## What is an Oracle

Smart contracts are the building blocks of web3 and can be thought of as the
logic behind programmable money, although their use cases extend well beyond
just monetary transactions. A smart contract encapsulates some pre-defined logic
allowing anonymous participants to interact without a trusted intermediary. More
complex smart contracts might rely on external data from the web but blockchains
do not have the capability of directly relaying this information. Enter oracles.

Oracles are the gateway between a blockchain and the real world, providing the
mechanisms to arrive at a reliable consensus for a single data point when given
multiple sources. Oracles can then determine the most reliable value of the data
point after examining the provided answer of each data source. In this way,
oracles increase information integrity by removing the risk of a single point of
failure or outlier.

## Use Cases

Oracle services have many applicable uses in blockchain based applications
today, such as:

- Determining the current price of an asset for collateralized lending
- Determining the state of a tracking number to auto settle funds on arrival
- Determining the current standings of the MLB for fantasy sports rankings

Oracles can be used for a variety of data sets as long as there is a reliable
way to source the information.
