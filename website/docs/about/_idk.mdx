Switchboard is an oracle protocol deployed on **_Aptos_**, **_Near_**, and
**_Solana_**, and is responsible for how data is requested and routed through
the chain. At a high level, Switchboard is a resource controller and controls
how on-chain consumers can _"rent"_ off-chain resources to fulfill update
requests.

Switchboard's novel approach allows individual oracle networks to be created and
managed individually. Each Switchboard network has its own oracle queue which is
a round robin ordering of oracles watching the chain for update requests. When a
Switchboard resource, such as a data feed or randomness account, requests a new
value, the queue assigns a batch of oracles to the update requests and
automatically disperses the queue's specified reward to the oracle when they
respond within the quoroms majority. This allows DeFi protocols to tune their
oracles to their desired cost vs security model.
