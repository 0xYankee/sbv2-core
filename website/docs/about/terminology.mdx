| Aggregator         | An aggregator (data feed) holds the config for how and when an update can be requested from it's assigned oracle queue.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Curator            | Someone who scours the web and builds on-chain job definitions for publishers to build data feeds from.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Crank              | A priority queue of aggregators and their next available update time. The crank is the scheduling mechanism that allows feeds to be updated at a regular interval and reward the update requester for jump starting the system.                                                                        |
| History Buffer     | An aggregator can optionally add a history buffer and store the last N results on-chain with their update timestamp.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Job                | Stores the OracleJob definition of Switchboard tasks which instructs the oracles on how to fetch data off-chain.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Lease              | A lease escrow used to reward oracles for successfully updating a data feed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Oracle             | A node between the internet and the blockchain which facilitates the flow of information. An oracle reads in a feeds job definitions, calculates the result, and submits its response on-chain.                                                                                                        |
| Oracle Consensus   | How oracles come to agreement on the accepted on-chain result. Switchboard oracles use the median oracle response as the accepted result. A feed authority can control how many oracles are requested and how many must respond to influence its security.                                             |
| Oracle Queue       | Round-robin queue of oracles actively heartbeating on-chain. When an update is requested from a queue, the next N oracles are assigned to the update request and cycled to the back of the queue.                                                                                                      |
| Publisher          | Someone who builds and creates a data feed on-chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Task               | An instruction an oracle executes. A task can fetch, parse, or transform a data point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Variance Threshold | A feed authority may specify a variance threshold to prevent redundant update requests and only allow oracle responses if the variance percentage between the last accepted result and the current value exceeds some threshold. Useful for conserving a lease's funds and extends the life of a feed. |
| VRF (Randomness)   | Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a prove-able cryptographic function that uses a private key to generate a pseudo-random value which can be verified by anyone with just the public key without leaking the VRF producer's secret key.                                                              |
