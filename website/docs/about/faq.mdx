### How decentralised is the Switchboard Network?

</summary>

Switchboard's oracle architecture consists of multiple staked nodes, our network
page [https://switchboard.xyz/network](https://switchboard.xyz/network) displays
the number of oracles live. To understand the architecture better, navigate to

### What is Switchboard’s economic model?

For utilizing VRFs (currently only on Solana), user has to pay 0.002 SOL on
every request of randomness, similar to data feeds, the fees consists of mainly
transaction fees (math and compute costs) and oracle incentives.
