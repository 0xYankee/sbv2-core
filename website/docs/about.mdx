# Switchboard

The oracle problem arises due to the inability of blockchains to interact
directly with external systems. Blockchains are isolated networks that only rely
on data stored in their ledger for consensus. The deterministic nature of smart
contracts is a result of the narrow focus of blockchain consensus and their
ability to execute exactly as written with a higher degree of certainty than
traditional systems. Incorrect reporting of external data can lead to
devastating outcomes for on-chain applications dependent on these data feeds.

Switchboard is a multi-chain, permissionless oracle protocol that bridges the
gap between off-chain data and on-chain smart contracts. It's designed to
provide developers with the tools to create feature-rich decentralized
applications (dApps).

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Oracle Network**: Connects blockchain platforms to real-world
  data sources.
- **Independent Oracle Queues**: Allows customization of security levels and
  configuration parameters.
- **Economic Incentives**: Encourages honest behavior and network integrity.
- **Governance**: Controlled by network participants.
- **Access Control**: Ensures secure interactions with a queue.
- **Trusted Execution**: With Switchboard V3, oracles operate within a trusted
  execution environment.

## Use Cases

Switchboard is versatile and adaptable, making it suitable for a wide range of
use cases, including:

- **Data Feeds**: Access to real-world information for blockchain-based
  applications.
- **Random Number Generation**: Secure and unbiased random number generation for
  on-chain applications.
- **Serverless Execution**: Triggering smart contracts based on specific
  off-chain conditions.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Transparent governance and
  decision-making within decentralized organizations.
- **Escrow Services**: Creation of trustless, automated escrow systems.
- **Prediction Markets**: Forecasting future events using verifiable off-chain
  data and trusted execution environments.
