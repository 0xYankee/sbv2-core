# Integration Checklist

Switchboard data feeds are permissionless in that anyone can configure their own
sources and oracle consensus to achieve their desired level of security. When
creating Switchboard feeds, you will need to create the following on-chain
accounts:

- Aggregator Account
- Permission Account
- Lease Account
- A JobAccount for each source of data.

## Read Access

Switchboard data feeds on Solana are treated as public utilities where anyone
can read the current on-chain state.
