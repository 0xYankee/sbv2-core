## Checkout

During checkout, the publisher will create the necessary accounts for your data
feed.

### Lease

  <Grid item md={5} sm={12}>
    <b>
      <u>Automatic Updates</u>
    </b>
    <Typography>
      The <i>Enable automatic updates</i> checkbox determines whether your data
      feed will be added to a crank. A crank allows data feeds to be updated at
      regular intervals. Event based feeds should uncheck this box.
    </Typography>
    <br />
    <b>
      <u>Update Interval</u>
    </b>
    <Typography>
      The update interval lets you configure how often and how long a data feed
      should be updated for. This derives the total cost deposited into the
      lease contract escrow account, which is used to fund oracles each time a
      feed is updated. You can extend or terminate a lease at anytime.

### Account Creation

<Grid container spacing={3} justifyContent="space-around">
  <Grid item md={6} order={{ xs: 2, md: 1 }}>
    <MarkdownImage
      img="/img/publisher/Account_Creation.png"
      sx={{ borderWidth: "thin", border: "1px solid #D3D3D3", borderRadius: 3 }}
    />
  </Grid>
  <Grid item md={6} order={{ xs: 1, md: 2 }}>
    <Typography>
      The <i>Account Creation</i> modal gives you a summary of your balance
      changes before any on-chain transactions occur. Once you have verified the
      total cost, hit <i>Create Feed</i> to submit the transactions.
    </Typography>
    <br />
    <Typography>
      After the accounts have been created, you will be redirected to the My
      Feeds page to view your newly created data feeds.
    </Typography>
    <br />
    <Typography>
      By default, data feeds are added to the permissionless queue, where they
      can begin updating immediately. Data feeds can be upgraded to the
      permissioned queue by submitting a request to the Switchboard DAO.
