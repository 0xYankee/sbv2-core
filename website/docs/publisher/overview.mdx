The publisher site is a decentralized marketplace that allows anyone to build a
data feed and deploy it on-chain. The site includes a directory of pre-defined
feeds from popular sources such as Coinbase or Binance, as well as on-chain
sources like Orca and OpenBook. The publisher site streamlines the on-chain
workflow and allows a user to configure a data feed from a convenient UI.

The publisher allows you to build feeds on

- Aptos [Mainnet / Testnet]
- CoreDAO [Mainnet / Testnet]
- NEAR [Mainnet / Testnet]
- Solana [Mainnet-Beta / Devnet]
- Starknet [goerli-alpha]

## Directory

The publisher site includes some pre-defined sources to help developers publish
data feeds. Pre-defined sources can be added to your basket by selecting them in
the directory, from there you can toggle individual data sources to meet your
on-chain needs.
