An oracle queue can be governed by its network participants to control the
various queue configuration parameters, such as:

- `queue.minStake` - require a higher up-front cost for oracles to entice honest
  behavior
- `queue.reward` - control the oracle reward payout for successfully fulfilling
  update request
- `queue.slashingEnabled` - to disincentivize malicious oracle behavior
- Permit new oracles to join the network
