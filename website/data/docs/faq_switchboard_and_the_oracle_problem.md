Switchboard addresses the oracle problem in the following ways:

**Permissionless**: Developers can build their own data feeds, and optionally
spin up an application-specific free-standing oracle network for their feeds,
called an _oracle queue._

**Customization**: Different feeds and queues can be configured with a variety
of parameters, allowing developers to decide for themselves how to optimally
balance decentralization, security, and speed for their own unique use case.

**Decentralization**: Developers can decide between flexible governance options,
such as DAO governance, multisigs, privileged admins, or immutable definitions.
