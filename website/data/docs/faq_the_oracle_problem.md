The oracle problem in blockchain is caused by the inability of blockchains to
interact with external systems. Blockchains are isolated networks that only rely
on data stored in their ledger to form a consensus on binary questions such as
whether a public key holder signed a transaction with their corresponding
private key, whether a public address has enough funds to cover its transaction,
and whether a transaction type is valid within a smart contract. The
deterministic nature of smart contracts is due to the narrow focus of blockchain
consensus and their ability to execute exactly as written with a higher degree
of certainty than traditional systems.

Incorrect reporting can lead to devastating outcomes for on-chain applications
dependent on the data feeds. Different oracle solutions vary in their approach
to solving the problem, often making different tradeoffs between relying on
highly centralized, trusted data providers, or more-decentralized networks with
economic and cryptographic security measures. Similarly, different use cases
vary in their requirements for speed, fidelity, and resolution of their data
feeds.

Other oracle solutions require developers to choose from a limited selection of
data feeds, and offer no easy way to publish their own custom feed for the data
sources they need. In a dynamic, changing world, this versatility is critical to
unlock the full potential of decentralized applications.
