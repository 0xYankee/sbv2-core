Blockchains are not hardware, hence, true randomness is not achievable.
Switchboard’s VRF was modelled after Algorand’s **pseudo-random function**
implementation, allowing verifiable randomness to be generated on-chain. Use
cases such as Casinos, game theory, NFT minting mechanism can be relied on with
VRF.
