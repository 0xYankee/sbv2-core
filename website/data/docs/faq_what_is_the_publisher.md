The Publisher is a Switchboard application that allows a feed creator to bring
any data they need on-chain in under 60 seconds. Before the publisher, feed
creators would need to sign partnership deals with existing oracle providers
which resulted in a weeks long process.

The Publisher allows a user to:

- Browse existing jobs in the catalog
- Build a job from a set of pre-curated templates like fetching from common
  centralized exchanges
- Use the Build-Your-Own-Feed tool to create custom jobs
- Test new jobs
- Create new data feeds
- Manage and monitor their feeds
