Switchboard is a multi-chain, permissionless oracle protocol for general purpose
data feeds and verifiable randomness (VRF).

Switchboard gets its name from the early days of phone networks, where operators
would shuffle telephone lines around a 'switchboard' to complete a circuit and
forward a dialerâ€™s call to the next hop in the circuit. Similarly, Switchboard,
our oracle network is responsible for how external data gets updated and routed
through a blockchain until it reaches its appropriate destination.
