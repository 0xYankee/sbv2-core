Blockchains do not have the capability of directly relaying information from
off-chain to on-chain. Hence, enter oracles, a gateway between blockchain and
real world data.

An oracle is not the data source, it is an infrastructure layer for querying,
verifying and authenticating external data sources; which is relayed to the
blockchain for a smart contract to read and carry out necessary course of action
for its intended product.
