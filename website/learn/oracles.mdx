# Oracles

# Oracle Architecture

A Switchboard oracle is a Node.js container that sits between the Solana
blockchain and the internet and waits for update requests from an oracle queue.
An oracle queue assigns updates to oracles in a round robin fashion.

An oracle account is a program derived address (PDA) between the oracle queue
itâ€™s being initialized for, as well as the oracles staking wallet. Before an
oracle is granted permissions to use a queue, it must transfer the minimum stake
amount, set by the queue, to its staking wallet.

## Staking

An oracle is required to transfer `queue.minStake` tokens to its staking wallet,
`oracle.tokenAccount`, before being granted queue permissions. The minStake acts
as an insurance policy to entice honest oracle behavior.

## Heartbeat

An oracle is required to heartbeat on-chain in order to join the queue and be
assigned update request. An oracle must heartbeat before the queue's specified
`queue.oracleTimeout` or it will be removed from the queue by the queue's
garbage collector.

## Metrics

The oracle also tracks its performance, `oracle.metrics`.

## Cost & Reward Estimations

An oracle is required to submit a SaveResult transaction each time it updates a
feed. This fee is dependent on the network the oracle is assigned to and the
current gas cost.

$T_{perUpdate}=T_{queueReward} - T_{txnCost}$

where,

- `T` is the raw token amount in base units (_Ex: lamports or satoshis_)

To estimate an oracles cost basis, you will need to know a queue's capacity
(Oracles, Feeds, VRFs) and the average number of update request an oracle is
assigned over a given time period.

You will also need to factor in the oracle's heartbeat cost, which is 5000
lamports each. The number of heartbeats is dependent on its
`queue.oracleTimeout`, which determines how often an oracle is required to
heartbeat.
