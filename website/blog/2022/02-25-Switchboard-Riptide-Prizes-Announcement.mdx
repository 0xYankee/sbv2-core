# Switchboard x Riptide Prizes Announcement

Switchboard is sponsoring the Solana Riptide hackathon with $30k in prizes for
the top 3 teams that best integrate Switchboard. Less than a year ago
Switchboard was founded after a hackathon submission and we are grateful for the
opportunity to pay it back to the developer community.

Switchboard v2 allows for permission-less feeds — bring any public data point
on-chain using a network of independent oracle operators. Switchboard recently
released V2 of its Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF), which allows developers
to request a verifiable random value, with proof verification entirely on-chain.
Verifiable randomness brings new use cases to Solana and allows developers to
provide open, verifiable lotteries in their on-chain programs.

## Prizes

Switchboard will be offering the following prizes:

**First Prize ($15k):** Best integration of Switchboard v2

**Second Prize ($10k):** Best use of Switchboard VRF

**Third Prize ($5k):** Most interesting integration of Switchboard

## Project Ideas

- **Lease alerts**: Switchboard V2 aggregators rely on a lease account to fund
  oracles for completing an update request. Some form of email/discord/telegram
  alerting system could be useful for developers.

- **Constant Function Market Maker** —

- **Weather Microinsurance** — Utilize Switchboard’s permission-less feeds to
  publish weather data and allow on-chain settlement based on some predefined
  conditions.
