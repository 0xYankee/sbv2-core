# Dialed in with Switchboard: 3–14–22

> Dialed in with Switchboard is a weekly newsletter about the various on-going
> updates with Switchboard.

## Jupiter Swap Task

Switchboard is in the final stages of testing its newly created
[JupiterSwapTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#jupiterswaptask), which
will be rolled out to the oracles in the coming days.

Jupiter Swap is a liquidity aggregator on Solana and provides users with the
optimal route for a swap, ensuring they get the best price each time.

Switchboard currently allows publishers to build data feeds from a number of
supported liquidity protocols, such as Serum, Raydium, Orca, Saber, and
Mercurial. Switchboard’s integration of JupiterSwap’s SDK streamlines this
process, allowing publishers to specify an input and output token and be
confident they are being returned the best price for a given swap.

Check out
[Switchboard’s Job Directory](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/job-directory#jupiterswap)
for an example on how to use this new task.

## Raydium Swap Integration

Switchboard oracles will now resolve the swap price for a given Raydium pool
using the
[lpExchangeRateTask](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#lpexchangeratetask).
You can find a full list of supported Raydium AMM pools in their SDK:
[https://sdk.raydium.io/liquidity/mainnet.json](https://sdk.raydium.io/liquidity/mainnet.json).
