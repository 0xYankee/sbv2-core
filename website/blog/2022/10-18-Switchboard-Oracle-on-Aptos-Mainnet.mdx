# Switchboard Oracle on Aptos Mainnet

Aptos Labs has officially launched their L1 blockchain to mainnet on 17 October
2022! A great feat for Move developers to begin building products and use cases
on mainnet; providing end users with a fresh experience within Aptos’s
ecosystem.

Oracles play a crucial and integral role in the genesis of any blockchain
mainnet launch — providing developers with the necessary data (such as price,
weather, sports and more data fetch-able through Switchboard!) to plug into
their products.

Hence, in order to build a strong infrastructure foundation, Switchboard Labs is
proud and thrilled to announce the official co-launch of our oracle protocol
with Aptos Labs and many of its ecosystem protocols!

In this article, we’ll discuss:

- Aptos grant

- What we currently support

- What to look out for

- Links and resources to start developing

## Aptos Grant

In the past 2 months of research and development, we’ve discussed closely with
Aptos regarding supporting data needs for day 1 on Aptos mainnet. From the sheer
amount of support and the increasing number of protocols building on Aptos, we
realise the need for infrastructure protocols to be readily available. By
expanding our oracle protocol to Aptos for its mainnet launch, Switchboard Labs
aim to enhance developer experience and scaffold a strong foundation for the
ecosystem.

> to learn about our expansion to Aptos.

We’d love to take the opportunity to thank Aptos for supporting us with a grant
to:

- Kickstart research and development in the infancy stage;

- Speedily push production to mainnet;

- Manage developer operations;

- Fund initial set of first-party Switchboard sponsored feeds.

## What Switchboard currently support

As Switchboard Labs expands our oracle to support Aptos, our products retain its
values and familiarities to provide the best developer experience for builders
across the chains.

> # _Bringing the **Switchboard Experience** to a **multi-chain** level._

### **Explorer**

On day 1 of mainnet, as mentioned above, Switchboard Labs will sponsor a set of
first-party data feeds to provide a quick start for developers to consume the
data. These data feeds can be found on the
[Explorer](https://switchboard.xyz/explorer) page.

### **Publisher**

On day 1 of mainnet, the Publisher retains its features of the catalog and
custom feed builder (with Web 2 fetch, Parse, Math, Logic task types readily
available).

## What to look out for

As we continue to build and collaborate closely with various protocols building
on Aptos, expect to see support for fetching of on-chain price data from AMMs,
CLOBs and more. Additionally, we will continue to update our documentation and
provide developer support to current and new builders across the Aptos
ecosystem!

We’re excited to be on this journey with Aptos and its ecosystem to plug into
the next wave of blockchain applications. Stick around as announcements
regarding workshops and more are coming soon!
