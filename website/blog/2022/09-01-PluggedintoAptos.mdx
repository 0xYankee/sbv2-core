PluggedintoAptos

> # **How to bring the next million developers to Web 3?**

In order to empower developers to build in Web 3, Switchboard preaches and
builds its oracle protocol with a developer-first approach. However, how can we
reach **MORE** developers?

Switchboard Labs believes the future of an infrastructure protocol is to expand
horizontally, bringing its network and tooling to more developers.

> # Question: Which chain?

With the emergence of the new blockchain, [Aptos](https://aptoslabs.com/) and
its enticing Move codebase, attracting both experienced and novice Web 3
developers. Additionally, in the matter of a handful of months, we’ve seen many
projects seeking to establish its presence in Aptos.

Hence, we believe that by expanding our oracle network and building blocks to
Aptos, we can ultimately empower the next wave of developers.

> # #PluggedintoAptos

We are officially announcing Switchboard’s first multi-chain expansion is to the
**Aptos blockchain**.

> # wen dev-net?

Switchboard Labs has been heads down to build out the very same
developer-friendly experience for Aptos developers.

Word on the street is: **\*The more “#PluggedintoAptos” we receive, the faster
we ship**.\*

Yes, we’re starting a MOVEment and this is only the beginning. Watch out for the
very first **permission-less**, **decentralized**, **customizable** oracle
implementation on Aptos.

_It’ll be electrifying._
