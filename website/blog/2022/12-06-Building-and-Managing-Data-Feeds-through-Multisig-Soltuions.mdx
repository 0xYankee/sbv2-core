# Building & Managing Data Feeds through Multisig Soltuions

Building & Managing Data Feeds through Multisig Solutions

Switchboard protocol provides a permissionless way to customize data feeds to
your specific use cases. Our approach has always been developer-first, allowing
developers to build feeds through our low-code interface, the
[Publisher](https://app.switchboard.xyz) app and manage seamlessly all in the
same application.

As our ecosystem protocols grow and scale together with Switchboard, there will
be protocols that require a similar set of data feeds. Take example of a group
of DeFi protocol, they are likely integrating with similar crypto assets and
thus, requiring a similar set of price feeds to plug into their protocols.

In order for teams and developers to co-own data feeds in a secure manner, a
multi-signature (Multisig) wallet solution will be able to achieve it.

# Building and Managing Data Feeds through Multisig Solutions

After receiving requests from mainly DeFi protocols, we’ve integrated with
Multisig solutions on Solana to bring this feature to our users. Switchboard
users are now able to utilise Multisigs to build, fund and manage their data
feeds with external parties.

## What is a Multisig?

A multi-signature wallet allows a group of users to approve a transaction before
it can be executed. Many individuals and teams desire to have multiple parties
sign off on a transaction, such as payments or withdrawals before it can be
executed. This allows for more robust security, as it spreads the responsibility
of your digital assets to multiple parties, and avoids a single point of failure
in the case of a compromised individual or wallet.

Multiple users can be required to manage any on-chain transaction, for example
requiring multiple users to sign a payment transaction, purchasing an NFT,
withdrawal from a wallet or in Switchboard’s use case: updating the settings and
funding of a data feed.

## How does Multisig work with Switchboard?

When creating a data feed, users can opt to integrate their data feeds with a
Multisig wallet. To do so, they will either need to:

- Create a feed through a Multisig wallet and have its authority immediately
  under the Multisig wallet’s address upon creation;
- Create a feed natively on Switchboard’s
  [Publisher](https://app.switchboard.xyz) and transfer its authority to a
  Multisig wallet address (as shown in image).

This integration allows multiple users in the Multisig to gain ownership of the
data feed and to execute transactions responsibly such as funding the lease of
the feed or updating the feed configurations.

## Benefits of using Switchboard through a Multisig solution

Bringing back the example from above, a group of DeFi protocol can set up a
Multisig wallet to manage a group of price feeds that they require for their
protocols. By doing so, they can save on funds by sharing feeds, instead of
funding them individually. Since fees are shared amongst more parties, they can
opt for the best feed security by maximising the number of _jobResults_ and
_oracleResults_ for each feed.

The integration helps improve developer operations on the protocol side but
ultimately, the end users benefit greatly from this as well. The knowledge of
knowing that the protocols are using a set of price feeds controlled through a
Multisig wallet — provides an additional layer of security as responsibility and
cross-checking are heightened.

# To conclude

Switchboard users are able to utilise Multisig applications to build, manage and
fund data feeds to not only benefit on the protocol level but for their end
users too.
