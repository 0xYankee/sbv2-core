# Switchboard Oracle on Near Mainnet Alpha

After 1–2 months of researching, building, testing and hardcore shipping,
Switchboard Labs is proud and happy to present to you, our mainnet alpha
implementation on NEAR!

In this article, we’ll discuss the following:

- NEAR Foundation grant

- What we currently support

- What to look out for

- Links and resources to start developing

## NEAR Foundation Grant

In the past 2 months of research and development, we’ve been in active
discussions with the NEAR Foundation about the NEAR ecosystem. We quickly
learned there is a need for more projects contributing to the infrastructure of
the NEAR ecosystem. In particular, tools that help support the developer
experience.

> Read our [**_#PluggedintoNEAR_**](/blog/2022/09/13/PluggedintoNEAR) article to
> learn about our expansion to NEAR.

We’d love to take the opportunity to thank the NEAR Foundation for supporting us
with a grant to:

- Kickstart research and development in the infancy stage;

- Steadily push mainnet alpha to production;

- Manage developer operations;

- Fund initial set of first-party Switchboard sponsored feeds.

## What does Switchboard currently support?

As Switchboard Labs expands our oracle to support NEAR, our products retain its
values and familiarities to provide the best developer experience for builders
across the chains.

### Explorer

As mentioned above, Switchboard Labs will sponsor a set of first-party data
feeds to provide a quick start for developers to copy the feed address with ease
and plug them into their programs to read the data. These data feeds are namely
the top few cryptocurrencies and they can be found on the
[Explorer](https://switchboard.xyz/explorer) page.

### **Publisher**

The [Publisher](https://app.switchboard.xyz) retains its features of the catalog
and custom feed builder (with Web 2 fetch, Parse, Math, Logic task types readily
available). With the Publisher’s core features of permissionlessness and
customizability, developers can build, fund and manage their data feeds all on
our application without the need of any form contact or friction.

## What to look out for?

As we continue to improve and collaborate closely with various protocols on
NEAR, expect to see new Web 3 fetch task types populating in the custom feed
builder. Those task types will support fetching of on-chain price data from
AMMs, CLOBs and more. Additionally, we will continue to update our documentation
and provide developer support to current and new builders across the NEAR
ecosystem!

We’re excited to be a part of NEAR and its ecosystem to plug into the next wave
of blockchain applications. Stick around as announcements regarding workshops
and more coming soon!
