# #PluggedintoNEAR

> # Switchboard’s multi-chain expansion plan

At Switchboard, we believe the future of oracle protocols is to expand across
the ever-growing amount of blockchains — empowering any developer coming from
any background, touching first base on any codebase, blockchain and ecosystem.

> # Question: Which chain?

The very first inception of Switchboard protocol is built on top of the Rust
program language. We’ve seen the growing love for Rust in developers, and in
order to empower more developers building with Rust, it makes sense to expand
towards another R*ust-based* blockchain.

> # #PluggedintoNEAR

With that said, Switchboard Labs is excited to officially announce the expansion
of Switchboard protocol to **NEAR** blockchain!

> # What does Switchboard bring to the NEAR ecosystem?

Being a permissionless oracle protocol, Switchboard’s philosophy is to firstly
build a low-code UI that reduces friction for developers. Instead of going
through layers of contacts to spin up a generic data feed, on Switchboard’s
Publisher, a developer can build their own data feed within minutes and have
full customizability, management over their own feeds.

Apart from our core infrastructure products, by bringing our oracle
infrastructure to NEAR, we believe providing developer workshops to educate and
onboard new developers is of utmost importance. Ultimately, this will help
enhance current and future developers’ building experience on NEAR blockchain.

> # wen dev-net?

Switchboard Labs has been heads down to build out the very same
developer-friendly experience for NEAR developers.

Word on the street is: **\*The more “#PluggedintoNEAR” we receive, we just might
have a surprise during NEARCON**.\*

Join our community and build with Switchboard where you plug and play with
oracles!

_It’ll be electrifying._
