# Switchboard Publisher

Since inception, Switchboard was built with a primary goal in mind: democratize
data feeds such that any developer can build, configure, and own their data
on-chain. By enabling developers and lowering the barrier of entry for bringing
data on-chain, we will help foster the next wave of applications for Web 3.

## Background

Blockchains cannot communicate with Web 2 services and need an intermediary to
facilitate this exchange. Solana programs need an oracle service to fetch and
pre-populate the data on-chain before it can be used by a program. A fault
tolerant data feed should have multiple off-chain sources defined, which can be
time consuming for developers to seek out and configure.

## Publisher

Enter the [Publisher](http://app.switchboard.xyz).

The Publisher is a decentralized data catalog, giving data feed publishers
(typically developers) a convenient interface to find and build data feeds. The
Publisher includes a catalog of curated job definitions from a wide array of
sources ranging from FTX, Coinbase, ESPN, or even Weather.com.

This streamlines the data feed creation process and allows a developer to
publish a data feed on-chain in under 60 seconds! The Publisher also includes a
_Feed Builder_ to build and test custom job definitions in a simple to use
drag-n-drop interface. After a publisher has created their feeds on-chain, they
can monitor and fund their data feed on the _My Feeds_ dashboard.

## Curator

The new Publisher decentralizes the data catalog and gives anybody the
opportunity to contribute and get rewarded. Curators are incentivized to scour
the internet and find unique data points that could be of interest to the
broader community.

**Steps of a Curator**

1. Finds a new data point

1. Build job definition in the Publisher

1. Add it to the decentralized catalog

**Incentives for a Curator**

The curator’s token wallet receives a kickback from any revenue generated from a
job definition, or anytime when a data feed is funded with the curator’s job
definition. This incentivizes the community to contribute and grow the
Switchboard data catalog and help enable web3 developers.

## Conclusion

The Publisher is an exciting milestone for Switchboard because it opens up the
data catalog to the community and allows anyone to contribute and get rewarded.

Switchboard is excited to bring further decentralization to the oracle space and
welcome any feedback from the community. We’re excited to see what the community
will build with it next; give us a ring, our line is open!
