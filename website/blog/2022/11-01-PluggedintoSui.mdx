## How can Switchboard empower the next wave of blockchain applications?

Oracles remain a crucial role player in any blockchain ecosystem, acting as the
intermediary between blockchains and real world data. Switchboard has provided,
and continues to provide, permissionless data for developers to build on top of.

Since pre-deployment of the Switchboard oracle protocol, we have stood by the
ideology of putting the developer experience first and empowering developers
with the tools they need to build innovative blockchain applications. In order
to empower and reach more developers, Switchboard Labs believes that
infrastructure protocols must expand horizontally across blockchains, bringing
their network and tooling to more developers.

## Question: Which chain?

A new, promising blockchain has emerged:[ Sui](https://sui.io/)
by[ Mysten Labs.](https://mystenlabs.com/) . Mysten was launched in 2021 by
former executives of Meta’s Novi Research and lead architects of the Diem
blockchain and Move programming language. The company’s inaugural product, Sui,
is a decentralised, proof of stake blockchain that builds on important
innovations in consensus algorithms and leverages novel data structures to
deliver a high-performance, low-cost Layer 1.

> **\*Quote from Mysten Labs: **“_Oracle networks represent critical web3
> tooling which developers rely on to build high-performing dApps. We are
> excited to partner with Switchboard and empower our community to curate their
> own data sources and publish permissionless data feeds to the Sui
> blockchain_.”\*

Mysten Lab’s technological advancements and vision have attracted and welcomed
many developers around the world to the Sui ecosystem. In a handful of months,
we’ve seen many aspiring teams building exciting projects seeking to establish
their presence on Sui.

Hence, we believe that by expanding our oracle network and building blocks to
Sui, we can ultimately empower the next wave of developers to build blockchain
applications welcoming the next billion users to web3.

## #PluggedintoSui

We are officially announcing Switchboard’s next multi-chain expansion to the
**Sui blockchain**!

Our core application, Publisher and Explorer, will retain its value and
familiarity across the chains to enhance overall developing experience. We’re
thrilled to be a part of this journey and do keep a look out for the very first
**permission-less**, **decentralised**, **customisable** oracle implementation
on Sui — providing developers with general purpose data feeds (price, sports,
weather, events data, etc.) and Verifiable Random Function (VRF).

_It’ll be electrifying!_
