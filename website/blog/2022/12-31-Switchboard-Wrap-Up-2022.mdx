# Switchboard Wrap Up 2022

Switchboard Labs wishes our Operators, Publishers and everyone a very happy new
year! In this yearâ€™s Switchboard Wrap Up, weâ€™ll touch on these pointers:

- Notable achievements;
- The Switchboard Experience;
- The Switchboard Expansion;
- The Switchboard Ecosystem;
- Teasers to Switchboard Unwrap 2023!

# Notable achievements in 2022

Before we continue to embark on the oracle journey, letâ€™s slow down and take a
look at what weâ€™ve accomplished so far in 2022.

- Jan 22: Solanaâ€™s 1st **permissionless** **oracle network**
  ([V2 Announcement](/blog/2022/01/27/Switchboard-V2-is-LIVE))
- Feb 22: Solanaâ€™s 1st fully on-chain VRF implementation
- Jun 22: Solanaâ€™s 1st **decentralised** **data catalog**
  ([Publisher Announcement](/blog/2022/06/22/Switchboard-Publisher))
- Jul 22: Switchboard **1st Anniversary**
  ([Switchboard 360: Year in Review](/blog/2022/08/29/Switchboard-360-Looking-Back-Forward-and-All-Around))
- Sep 22 and onwards: Switchboard Expansion to a multi-chain level!

We would like to take this opportunity to thank the Switchboard ecosystem and
the developer community for pushing the boundaries with us, building a fully
permissionless and customisable oracle protocol was not easy. However, this is
just the beginning, read on the find out about â€¦ v3! \*wink\*

# The Switchboard Experience

To expand on the aforementioned, Switchboardâ€™s goal is to empower developers
with all the data they need (from both on/off-chain) â€” with the least amount of
friction to build a suite of products on blockchain technology.

To do so, weâ€™ve purposefully designed the Switchboard Publisher app to be:

- Decentralised ðŸ‘‰ [Data catalog](https://app.switchboard.xyz) allows users to
  curate feed templates, contribute to leases.
- Permissionless ðŸ‘‰ [Feed builder](https://app.switchboard.xyz/build/tool)
  allows users to design and customise their data feeds within minutes without
  the need of a middlemen, eliminating any friction for developers.

Read the Switchboard Experience Twitter thread to find out more!

Weâ€™re actively in discussion with partners and teams to improve on the
Switchboard Experience such as developer tooling, documentation and examples.

# The Switchboard Expansion

1 of our goals for Q3â€“4 of 2022 was to bring the Switchboard Experience to a
multi-chain level. Weâ€™re proud to announce that weâ€™ve natively implemented on
these L1 blockchains! Hereâ€™s the quick links to the Switchboard implementation
on each blockchain:

- Aptos:
  [https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-aptos](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-aptos)
- Near:
  [https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-near](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-near)
- Solana:
  [https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-solana](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-solana)
- Sui:
  [https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-sui](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-sui)

Switchboardâ€™s ultimate goal is to empower ALL developers, regardless of which
blockchain, programming language, etc to be able to fetch data effortlessly.
With that, in 2023, stay tuned for more announcements on the Switchboard
Expansion â€” Bringing the Switchboard Experience to a multi-chain level!

# **The Switchboard Ecosystem**

Check out our Ecosystem page
([https://switchboard.xyz/ecosystem](https://switchboard.xyz/ecosystem)) to find
out about the products built on top of Switchboard!

## Expansion leads to a bigger Ecosystem

As we expand to multiple L1 blockchains, the Switchboard Ecosystem evidently
grows faster and stronger. Weâ€™ve experience a similar suite of products being
built on the different features of each L1 blockchain.

Despite the variety of products already built on top of us, there are many
uncharted territories and opportunities for interesting products using niche
off-chain data â€” such as insurance protocols and decentralised prediction
markets.

## Hackathons and workshops

Apart from empowering developers by expanding to multiple blockchains, in 2023,
we plan to conduct more workshops & hackathons with communities! This will
ultimately provide both new and experienced developers to learn and build
something cool with Switchboard. Read on to find out about our participation at
a community-led hackathon by LamportDAO!

# Switchboard Unwrap 2023 (TEASERS)

## Solana Sandstorm Hackathon

To kickoff 2023, the community at LamportDAO has took the initiative to host a
hackathon, Solana Sandstorm in January.

As an infrastructure protocol, weâ€™ve provided an oracle-integration track to
incentivise developers to build with our customisable data feeds or relying on
our verifiable randomness! Stay tuned for more information.

## Switchboard v3

In the current Switchboard v2 architecture, users rely on the consensus of
Switchboard approved staked nodes (oracles) which means we must have heavy
trust-assumption on these nodes running off-chain.

> What if Switchboard v3 can solve this? Stay tuned!

Weâ€™re thrilled and canâ€™t wait to share more! Currently, weâ€™re testing this
iteration internally and will provide more details as soon as itâ€™s ready.

# Switchboard Wrap Up 2022

Once again, weâ€™d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone and cheers to
the new year! Weâ€™ve achieve great feats in 2022 but letâ€™s continue to embark on
our oracle journey into 2023 with greater heights to conquer!

As we move forward, weâ€™re looking for rockstars to join us in building the
Switchboard protocol for developers just like yourself and empower them to build
the next generation of blockchain technology!

All types of contributors across the board (such as marketing, community, smart
contract development, etc) are welcomed! If Switchboard sounds interesting to
