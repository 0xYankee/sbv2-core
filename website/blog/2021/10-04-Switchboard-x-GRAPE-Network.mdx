# Switchboard x GRAPE Network

Switchboard is proud to announce a partnership with the Grape Network. The Grape
Network is creating the building blocks for decentralized social networks paving
the way for permission-less communities. Much like how the internet paved the
way for how we think about and form communities, Grape Network is leveraging the
Solana blockchain to take that to the next level. Utilizing the Solana
blockchain, user interactions are amplified with on-chain data allowing
different communities to interweave and form partnerships.

Switchboard is providing the on-chain oracle infrastructure for the Grape
Network to leverage, allowing each data source to be vetted and aligned to user
incentives. The Grape Network is currently using Switchboard to provide on-chain
data for community metrics, like number of wallets and total value locked (TVL),
as well as NFT metrics, like number of unique holders and number of NFTs per
community.

Switchboard is excited to form this partnership with the Grape Network and canâ€™t
wait to see what they build next!
