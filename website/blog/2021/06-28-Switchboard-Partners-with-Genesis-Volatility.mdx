# Switchboard partners with Genesis Volatility to provide on-chain volatility data on Solana

We’re excited to announce a partnership with Genesis Volatility, the leading
provider of crypto options data, to provide volatility data on-chain. Options
data has been one of the most requested feeds from projects building on Solana
and we’re proud to work with Genesis Volatility, to bring it to Solana’s mainnet
— starting today with BTC and ETH Implied Volatilities.
