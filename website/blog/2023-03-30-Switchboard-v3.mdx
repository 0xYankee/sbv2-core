# Introduction to Switchboard v3

Presenting Switchboard v3 — an oracle protocol using **Trusted Execution
Environments** (TEEs).

# Current oracle consensus mechanisms

Today, most oracle protocols achieve consensus using trusted nodes to aggregate
results to publish on-chain. For example, a price feed involves a number of
oracles aggregating a number of results from different sources and publishing
the results on-chain.

From the example, this carries the assumption of an honest majority of nodes
answering correctly. This introduces additional overhead of additional network
fees (to incentivise oracles) and latency waiting for sources to respond/network
propagation.

Additionally, if an oracle is responsible for securing millions of TVL on each
update, shouldn’t the oracle be at risk of losing millions of dollars on each
update to align on incentives? This form of economic majority introduces
additional challenges with capital efficiency.

What if there was a way to use verifiable computation and cryptography so that
you didn’t need to rely exclusively on an economic majority for every
transaction? What if you could rely on just 1 of N nodes to respond and know the
result was accurate?

# How is Switchboard v3 different?

TRUST BUT VERIFY!

Switchboard v3’s TEEs enable oracles to become verifiable, offering low latency,
low cost and most importantly verifiable compute services.

- Data retrieval was indeed from the configured source;
- Code execution was executed as intended.

To simply put it, when you tell the oracles to do XYZ, the oracles can execute
the jobs and publish the data, all in a verifiable manner.

# Current usage: Switchboard v2

Since inception, Switchboard believes in a developer-first approach where we’ve
empowered developers with the necessary tools to explore, build and manage data
feeds — such as the Explorer and Publisher.

# Future usage: Switchboard v3

Being able to offer verifiable compute services as part of feed creation allows
for:

- Fast & secure data feeds
- Incorporate advanced calculations & risk metrics into price feeds
- Customized logic & support for any API
- and much more!

A literal switchboard.

Now, imagine yourself as a developer, in a world where a literal web3
_switchboard_ is accessible, where you plug and play with data, tools, services,
all provided by Switchboard Services!

# Wen v3?

Stay plugged in! We’re heads down finalizing on our Switchboard v3 iteration.
Soon, we will be natively implemented on all of the chains we support and more
to come!
