# Dialed in with Switchboard: 2023 Q1

Bringing back the ‘Dialed in with Switchboard’ series where we wrap up
Switchboard’s endeavours every quarterly!

In 2023 Q1, Switchboard continues to strive for excellence in areas such as the
ongoing Switchboard Expansion and growing our developer community!

# Statistics

Our statistics on Solana has improved overall, such as increasing our percentage
of transactions to 8–10% of total Solana transactions; and other achievements
like doubling our VRF requests count since last quarter.

# Community-led Solana Hackathon

Switchboard kicked off the year with a community initiated hackathon, Solana
Sandstorm hosted by LamportDAO and Helius Labs.

Switchboard’s vision is to empower developers from any community and ecosystem
to build seamlessly and permissionlessly. Hence, this hackathon allowed us to
reach these developers to empower them via a workshop and grant to help them
continue build their project.

From this hackathon, we hosted a Switchboard Oracle integration track where the
most interesting use case will receive a $1,000 USD grant. At the end of the 2
week event, we received a total of 14 submissions out of 267 and 4 of these
projects (including the winner) have continued to build till the time of
writing.

More importantly, we managed to highlight to developers the ease of building on
Switchboard and helped these developers to build unique use cases such as:

- The first Formula 1 fantasy game using Switchboard’s data feeds to fetch real
  world events.
- No-loss lottery protocols using randomness to derive a winner out of the
  participated pool.

# The Switchboard Expansion

Apart from the community wins, in this quarter, we’ve expanded to 2 more
ecosystems. We’re now on Core DAO mainnet and Starknet goerli-alpha!

Check out our Github links for
[Core](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-evm) and
[Starknet](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/sbv2-starknet)!

#SuiBuilderHero Award

Additionally, Switchboard received the #SuiBuilderHero Award where they
recognize early contributions to the ecosystem and community.

# Switchboard v3

Lastly, we’ve announced the ideas behind Switchboard v3 where the oracles will
be implemented with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), improving the
security, aligning the incentives and eventually, empower more developers with
the products built around the technology of TEEs.

Read more in this Twitter thread!

# Summary

Switchboard continues to expand its oracle infrastructure to empower developers
and build a strong, robust developer community to build, educate and share
blockchain technology. Thank you for dialing in with Switchboard!
