# #PluggedintoCore

At Switchboard, we believe the future of oracle protocols is to expand across
the ever-growing amount of blockchains — empowering any developer coming from
any background, touching first base on any codebase, blockchain and ecosystem.

# Question: Which chain?

> #PluggedintoCore

[Core’s Satoshi Plus Consensus Mechanism](https://docs.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.5/satoshi-plus-consensus)
(leveraging the Bitcoin mining hashrate) delivers the composability of an EVM
compatible blockchain — what this means is Core combines the optimal features of
Proof of Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) in order to achieve the
maximum security, scalability and decentralization, all with incredibly low
fees.

With the features aforementioned, this inlines with the visions of Switchboard
oracle protocol. Switchboard Labs is excited to officially announce the
expansion of Switchboard protocol to **Core** blockchain!

# What does Switchboard bring to the Core ecosystem?

By bringing our oracle network to Core, developers are empowered and equipped
with the set of tools to fetch on/off-chain data to plug into their use cases.
Data such as price, sports, weather data can be brought on-chain to bring many
ideas into fruition and ultimately, enhancing the end users’ experience.

Additionally, being a permissionless oracle protocol, Switchboard has built a
low-code interface on our [Publisher app](https://app.switchboard.xyz) that
reduces friction for developers. Instead of going through layers of contacts to
spin up any data feed, on Switchboard’s Publisher, a developer can build their
data feeds within minutes and have full customisability, management over their
own feeds.

Ultimately, this will help enhance current and future developers’ building
experience on Core blockchain. Take a look at our Twitter thread regarding The
Switchboard Experience and the products that help to empower developers.

# Wen devnet?

Stay tuned to the devnet implementation on Core as it is coming soon! We’re
thrilled to share it and have developers like yourself to start building the
future of blockchain applications on Core.

Join our community and build with Switchboard where you plug and play with
oracles! Follow our socials and check out our documentation!
