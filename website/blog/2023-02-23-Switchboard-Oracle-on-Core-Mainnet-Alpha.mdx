# Switchboard Oracle on Core Mainnet Alpha

Core blockchain has officially launched to mainnet in Q1 2023 and Switchboard is
thrilled to support developers in the Core ecosystem with our oracle
infrastructure!

Oracles play a crucial and integral role in the genesis of any blockchain
mainnet launch — providing developers with the necessary data (such as price for
DeFi) to plug into their products.

Hence, in order to build a strong infrastructure foundation, Switchboard has
implemented our v2 iteration on to the Core blockchain.

In this article, we’ll discuss:

- What we currently support
- What to look out for
- Links and resources to start developing

> Read our [_**#PluggedintoCore**_](/blog/2023/01/26/PluggedintoCore) article to
> learn about our expansion to Core.

We’d love to take the opportunity to thank Core for supporting us to steadfast
kickstart research and development, and eventually push production to mainnet.

# What Switchboard currently support

As Switchboard Labs expands our oracle to support Core, our products retain its
values and familiarities to provide the best developer experience for the
builders in Core.

## Explorer

The [Explorer](https://switchboard.xyz/explorer) allows developers to view live
data feeds and integrate them with ease, by plugging in the feed address to
their contracts to read the data.

## Publisher

The [Publisher](https://app.switchboard.xyz/) retains its features of the
catalog and custom feed builder (with Web 2 fetch, Parse, Math, Logic task types
readily available). With the Publisher’s core features of permissionlessness and
customizability, developers can build, fund and manage their data feeds all on
our application without the need of any form contact or friction.
