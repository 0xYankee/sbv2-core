# Switchboard Oracle on Sui Mainnet

Sui has officially launched to mainnet and Switchboard is thrilled to support
developers in the Sui ecosystem with our oracle infrastructure!

Oracles play a crucial and integral role in the genesis of any blockchain
mainnet launch — providing developers with the necessary data (such as price for
DeFi) to plug into their products.

Hence, in order to build a strong infrastructure foundation, Switchboard has
implemented our v2 iteration on the Sui blockchain.

In this article, we’ll discuss:

- What we currently support
- What to look out for
- Links and resources to start developing

> Read our [**_#PluggedintoSui_**](/blog/2022/11/01/PluggedintoSui) article to
> learn about our expansion to Sui.

We’d love to take the opportunity to thank Sui for supporting us to hastily
kickstart the process of research and development, and eventually push
production to mainnet.

# What does Switchboard currently support

As Switchboard expands our oracle to support Sui, our products retain its values
and familiarities to provide the best developer experience for the builders on
Sui.

Bringing the Switchboard Experience to a multi-chain level

## Explorer

The [Explorer](https://switchboard.xyz/explorer) allows developers to view live
data feeds and integrate them with ease, by plugging in the feed address to
their contracts to read the data.

## Publisher

The [Publisher](https://app.switchboard.xyz/build/tool) retains its features of
the custom feed builder (with Web 2 fetch, Parse, Math, Logic task types readily
available). With the Publisher’s core features of permissionlessness and
customizability, developers can build, fund and manage their data feeds all on
our application without the need of any form of contact or friction.
