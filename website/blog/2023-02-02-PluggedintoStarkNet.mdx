# #PluggedintoStarknet

At Switchboard, we believe the future of oracle protocols is to expand across
the ever-growing amount of blockchains — empowering any developer coming from
any background, touching first base on any codebase, blockchain and ecosystem.

# _Question: Which chain?_

> _#PluggedintoStarknet_

Starknet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (often referred to as
ZK-Rollup). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any
decentralised application to achieve unlimited scale for its computation —
without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security.

With the features of being a scalable, composable and general purpose L2
blockchain, this inlines with the visions of Switchboard oracle protocol.
Switchboard Labs is excited to officially announce the expansion of Switchboard
protocol to **Starknet** blockchain!

# _What does Switchboard bring to the Starknet ecosystem?_

By bringing our oracle network to Starknet, developers are empowered and
equipped with the set of tools to fetch on/off-chain data to plug into their use
cases. Data such as price, sports, weather data can be brought on-chain to bring
many ideas into fruition and ultimately, enhancing the end users’ experience.

Additionally, being a permissionless oracle protocol, Switchboard has built a
low-code interface on our [Publisher app](https://app.switchboard.xyz) that
reduces friction for developers. Instead of going through layers of contacts to
spin up any data feed, on Switchboard’s Publisher, a developer can build their
data feeds within minutes and have full customisability, management over their
own feeds.

Ultimately, this will help enhance current and future developers’ building
experience on Starknet blockchain. Take a look at our Twitter thread regarding
The Switchboard Experience and the products that help to empower developers.

# _Wen mainnet?_

Switchboard Labs is thrilled to announce the devnet implementation on Starknet!
